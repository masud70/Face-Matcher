# Face Matcher

This application is crafted with React and leverages the faceapi.js library, which, in turn, is constructed upon tensorflow.js. This library simplifies the process of detecting, analyzing, and comparing faces within an image. To enhance detection accuracy, multiple expressions, including happy, angry, neutral, surprised, sad, etc., are captured during the analysis. Additionally, the application incorporates gender detection, providing an extra layer for refining result accuracy.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
